Vulkan renderer

# Building

[Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) is required.

If your version of the Vulkan SDK does not include [Slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) (before VulkanSDK version 1.3.296.0), slang must be installed manually.

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
`libxrandr-dev`
`libxineramade-dev`
`libxcursor-dev`
`libxi-dev`
`libxcb-keysyms1-dev`

All other dependencies are included under `thirdparty/`
